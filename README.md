# Sorting Algorithm

## The Challenge

"Create working code to sort following strings: kavxpfequl, ynsxcrxout, jrhmnjyvpb, kefrxznjsn, juaypzwoow, kaszncrqdc, tlvszaghul, owfjrozmdf, qcwhbmviaj, dakguurrhi. Do not use built-in functions, create your own. Make sure that your code is fast. Use any programming language."

## What I Used

I felt that a bubble sort algorithm was the best way to tackle this challenge. This code is located in the mySorter service. 

This is copied from comments in my code explaining the process as I understand it:

"With each iteration, we essentially push the item that should be last to its proper place. Each iteration will traverse one item less than the last since we know the previous last item is where it needs to be. The outer loop using i exists to determine how much less we need to traverse for each iteration. The inner loop using j is the loop that does the actual checking and swapping if necessary."

This project is also powered by AngularJS, CSS3 transitions, Sass, and Gulp.js build tasks.
